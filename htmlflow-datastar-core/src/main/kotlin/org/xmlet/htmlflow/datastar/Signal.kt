/**
 * Represents a Reactive Signal as defined by TC39 proposals.
 *
 * A [Signal] is a static representation of a Reactive Signal used by the data-star
 * processing environment. **Note: This class does not behave as a reactive signal.**
 * It is only a representation that provides metadata about the signal.
 *
 * The value is **not reactive** and will not be updated after initialization.
 *
 * @property name the name that identifies the signal
 * @property value the optional value associated with the signal (immutable after initialization)
 * @param case the case style that defines how the signal name is formatted in the string representation
